# Analyzing Chocolate Bar Ratings
Exploratory Data Analysis on the Chocolate Bar Ratings dataset provided on Kaggle by Rachael Tatman

### The Scope of this Analysis
**Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)** is one of the most crucial steps in a Data Science project. EDA in basic terms is a way of "Understanding the data with the help of visualizations and descriptive statistics". A lot of courses I signed up for in the past emphasised on the need to use EDA to understand datasets and use this information to either model a ML/DL problem or tell a convincing story about the dataset to a stakeholder. <br>
Therefore, through this project I made an attempt at improving my EDA skills using the Chocolate Bar Ratings Dataset.

### Source of the Dataset
<ul><li>The dataset used here have been acquired from <a href= "https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/chocolate-bar-ratings">Rachael Tatman's Chocolate Bar Ratings</a> dataset on Kaggle.</li>
<li>The original ratings were compiled by Brady Brelinski, Founding Member of the Manhattan Chocolate Society. For up-to-date information, as well as additional content (including interviews with craft chocolate makers), please see his website: <a href="http://flavorsofcacao.com/index.html">Flavors of Cacao</a></li></ul>
